# 3D-reconstruction
Some algorithms of reconstructing mesh from point cloud
tested on 

There are 4 dependencies needed: polyscope for visualization, Eigen and nlopt for matrix manipulation and solving linear equations, geometry-central for representation geometry, download Eigen and nlopt in folder 'deps', then colne polyscpoe and geometry-central via https://github.com/ezhangle/polyscope and https://github.com/nmwsharp/geometry-central 

mkdir build and cd build. Then run 

```bash
cmake ..
```
